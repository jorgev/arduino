This project is a small HTTP server that accepts (short) sentence fragments and sends the correct allophones for each word (assuming it is in our dictionary) to the speech synthesizer.

There are several files in this directory.  The primary file is build_status.ino, which is the actual sketch.  The other files are supporting files, which are used to generate the allophone table.
